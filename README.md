## Do you like this plugin?
That's amazing to hear ðŸ˜„! I attempt to keep it up to date as best as I can. However, it's a spare-time project that I mostly work on in the evening hours.
Would you like to support me, feel free to give a small donation so I can buy some snacks to eat when I'm beeing a keyboard warrior.
